## Svelte-Express-Starter

A starter project that allows you to run Svelte and Express together. I had a hard time finding resources online so I made this starter project to help others out.

Start the project by running `node server` and `npm run dev`. The project will be live on `localhost:3000` or whatever port you choose (if you edit server.js).
